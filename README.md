Editor / Terminal Themes    
======

These are themes I have created for iTerm, Textmate 2 and Jetbrains IDEs. 

**BirdsOfParadise**
  - brown background with minimal contrast and lots of color. Based on the TextMate theme
  - *there's also a FishOfParadise which is essentially the same as BirdsOfParadise but with a blueish background*

**FishTank**
  - slate blue background with minimal contrast and light colors

**Highway**
  - grey background with slightly more contrast and highway sign colors

**IC_Green_People**
  - different hues and shades of green, with a single red error color

**Dimmed_Monokai**
  - a port of the Textmate Dimmed Monokai theme

**Ciapre**
  - a port of the Textmate Ciapre theme

**EasyEyes**
  - one of the original themes I did, but may be outdated because I haven't used it in a while

Editor / Terminal Themes    
======

These are themes I have created for iTerm, Textmate 2 and Jetbrains IDEs. 

*Please note that I use the* **Pragmata Pro** *font which is not free. It is well worth the $9 that it costs, as it it is the best programming font I have ever used. You can get it at http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fsd/essential-pragmata-pro/regular.*

**BirdsOfParadise**
  - based on the TextMate BirdsOfParadise theme (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/Birds%20of%20Paradise)
  - brown background with minimal contrast and lots of color. Based on the TextMate theme

**FishTank**
  - slate blue background with minimal contrast and light colors

**Highway**
  - grey background with slightly more contrast and highway sign colors

**IC_Green_People**
  - different hues and shades of green, with a single red error color

**Dimmed_Monokai**
  - a port of the Textmate Dimmed Monokai theme (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/Dimmed-Monokai)
  - dark grey background with softer colors than regular Monokai

**Ciapre**
  - a port of the Textmate Ciapre theme (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/Ciapre)
  - blue background with minimal contrast colors

**FishOfParadise**
  - exactly like BirdsOfParadise but with a blueish background

**EasyEyes**
  - one of the original themes I did, but may be outdated because I haven't used it in a while

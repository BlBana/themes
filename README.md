Editor / Terminal Themes    
======

These are themes I have created for iTerm, Textmate 2 and Jetbrains IDEs. 

*Please note that I use the* **Pragmata Pro** *font which is not free. It is well worth the $9 that it costs, as it it is the best programming font I have ever used. You can get it at http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fsd/essential-pragmata-pro/regular.*

BirdsOfParadise
-----
  - based on the TextMate ([BirdsOfParadise](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/Birds%20of%20Paradise)) theme
  - brown background with minimal contrast and lots of color. Based on the TextMate theme

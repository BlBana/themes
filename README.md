Jetbrains / iTerm2 Themes    
======

These are themes I have created for iTerm, Textmate 2 and Jetbrains IDEs. 

*Please note that I use the* **Pragmata Pro** *font which is not free. It is well worth the $9 that it costs, as it it is the best programming font I have ever used. You can get it at http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fsd/essential-pragmata-pro/regular.*
